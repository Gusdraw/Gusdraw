- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gusdraw, a complete newbe on GitHub and coding coming from a creative background.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use the algorythms/apps that are on sites like DrawingBots so that i can experiment with my cnc to create art.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to dicover (from a very low knowlage base) how i can actually run/use the code I see on GitHub to experiment with images. Specifically I have no idea how to take the code and run it via (i assume) some GUI that will allow me to desegnate an image to work on.
- 💞️ I’m looking for help in understanding how all this works
- 📫 How to reach me, I assume on this Forum chat?
